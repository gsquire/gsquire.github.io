<p>This short post is a reflection on Rust in 2017 and some ideas I would love to see in 2018 written
in the spirit of <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/01/03/new-years-rust-a-call-for-community-blogposts.html">this</a>
blog post. I will keep things brief and try not to repeat what others have already shared.
There have been many wonderful ideas that makes me even more enthusiastic about Rust so I hope that
I can add to the excitement with a few of my own.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-programming">Asynchronous Programming</h2>
<p>Throughout the course of 2017 Rust saw tremendous efforts to make its asynchronous story better.
Futures has laid the groundwork for providing abstractions over things like I/O and CPU bound work.
Rust also saw the addition of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.22.0/unstable-book/language-features/generators.html">generators</a>
in nightly allowing a pleasant <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-await">async/await</a> syntax
that is familiar to developers coming from languages that support this style. This is a feature I
can not wait to see stabilize as it seems like one of the biggest blockers from having networking
programs that compete with Go or C++. A friend of mine at work has even mentioned this as being one
of the last features that Rust needs in order for him to adopt it for any new project.</p>
<h2 id="lifetimes">Lifetimes</h2>
<p>Lifetimes are already a core part of Rust but the reason I am mentioning it is to see if there are
any more resources out there I can learn from. I know the book has a brief part on it as well as the
nomicon but I still think my knowledge only scratches the surface. It would be great to see the
community write up some more in-depth documentation on how I can leverage this feature to make
my programs faster or more elegant. Perhaps this could be seen as the need for better internal documentation
as others have mentioned but it&rsquo;s one of the last corners of Rust I feel I haven&rsquo;t been comfortable with.</p>
<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>We are already fortunate to have a brilliant group of individuals who make Rust what it is today. This
includes the core team members, influential contributors, and all those who use Rust. I am constantly
impressed by the amount of effort people have made to ensure that Rust is seen as more than just a
programming language. I want to ask those reading to try and become a more active participant of the
Rust community in 2018. This is an intentionally broad statement as there are a seemingly infinite amount of
ways you can do this. You can contribute patches to Rust projects, write documentation, host a meeting,
or just respond to forum posts to voice your thoughts. I am sure we continually read about how open
and polite our community is and I want to echo that sentiment. Everyone wants Rust to succeed and will
appreciate any effort you can give. I am making it a goal myself to give back to the community more than
I did last year and it would be great even if only one other person shared this idea.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thank you to the entire community for your continued efforts that make Rust one of the most
exciting things I have been a part of for a long time.</p>
